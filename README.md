# python-crash-course
Welcome to the non-comprehensive Python crash course! This is intended for students in the CS300 term project group who need some help learning Python before we begin.

Start with [example.py](example.py) and then move on to [my_program.py](my_program.py). If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.
