This is a Python Basics file for the CS300 term project. This is a Python
multi-line comment.

Python contains most of the features of C++ in a simpler package. Let's go
over some differences.
 * C++ requires manual memory management. Python has a garbage collector that
   will usually free memory when a variable is released.
 * Python does not use braces around most scopes and instead relies on 
   indentation.
 * Python does not use semicolons at the end of lines. New lines are considered
   new statements, except in some cases such as multiline comments or within
   array and dictionary brackets.
 * Python is a "dynamically typed" language: variable types and functions are
   determined at runtime based on the data stored; you do not typically define
   types in the code.
 * Python does not have "pass by reference"; it uses "pass by assignment". This
   means that if a mutable object is passed into a function (e.g., a list), you
   can modify that object; if the variable is reassigned, the original object
   does not change. It's generally a good idea to return values  from functions
   rather than attempt to modify a parameter. View this Stack Overflow answer
   for more details: https://stackoverflow.com/a/986145
 * In Python, functions must be defined before they can be called. Prototypes do
   not exist, and Python's method of "forward declaration" is simply to
   implement the function before it will be used.
 * Python does not have the ternary operator (?:) or pre/postfix increment and
   decrement operators (++ and --).

# Let's start with libraries. Libraries are simple to import in Python:
import os                   # The os library allows us to read information about
                            # a user's computer such as the file system.
from os import path         # You can also import individual elements of a
                            # library.
import os.path as p         # Or import individual elements with an alias for
                            # easier access.


# To define a function, use "def" followed by the function name.
def my_func():
    # If the function does nothing, it should include the word "pass" to
    # indicate that it is empty and should be "passed" over.
    pass


# You can also include parameters/arguments.
def my_func2(arg1):
    pass


# One of the few times you may want to define a type explicitly is when you want
# to ensure a function receives only a certain data type.
def my_func3(arg1 : str):
    pass


# Here is a function that takes two integer arguments named "x" and "y" then
# returns the sum of these two numbers.
# Note that functions are by default "void" unless a return statement is used.
def sum(x : int, y : int):
    return x + y


# Here is a function that takes two integer arguments named "x" and "y" then

    # elements, indicated by -3.

    # if x = 10, then this will print 0 to 9.

    # You can fix this by adding + 1 to the second value.

# Now let's go over classes.
# This is a class that does not use inheritance.
class MyClass:

    # "__init__".
    # Any function within a class must have its first parameter refer to the
    # class instance. This parameter is typically called "self", though it can
    # be named anything. This parameter is automatic and should never actually
    # be supplied when calling the function.

        # Create an empty array variable.
        my_array = []

        # type or amount of data like a class without a class definition.

        my_null = None

    def my_class_func(self):
        print(self.my_var)  # Print the class variable "my_var" to the console.


# This is a class derived from the earlier class MyClass.
class MyChild(MyClass):
    # The constructor takes three arguments. The first argument is the
    # automatic reference to the class instance; the second and third are user
    # provided.
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
        # You need to explicitly call the parent's constructor. super() refers
        # only to the parent class, not the base class.
        super().__init__()
        # Now that the parent has been initialized, the child class can access
        # any members of the parent.
        print(self.my_var)

        # You can also pass in arguments and store them within the class.

    # is determined at runtime based on context. Note that the original function
    # in the parent class doesn't need the "virtual" keyword.
    def my_class_func(self):
        print("Overridden!")


# This line is magical! It says if the current module's name is "__main__", then
# let's run this code. This is somewhat equivalent to C++'s "int main()", but
# you will need to run the program this way at the bottom of the main file.
# If you want, you can define a function then call it here to remove some of the
# functionality from the "if" statement.
if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_list = create_list()
    my_dict = create_dict()

    # Uncomment any of these if you want to see what the output is.

    # print(sum(1, 5))
    # print(sum(2, 10))

    # Max:
    # print(max(1, 5))
    # print(max(5, 1))

    # Clamp:

    # print(clamp(0, 5, -1))

    # Equals:
    # print(equals(1, 1))
    # print(equals(1, 2))

    # While:
    # while_loop(10)

    # For range:
    # for_range(10)
    # for_range("ABC")      # This will throw an error that we cannot use
                            # "range" on a string object.

    # For loop on a list:
