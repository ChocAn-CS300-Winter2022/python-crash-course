'''
Welcome to the program section of the Python Crash Course. This program is going
to bring together some of the examples from example.py, and hopefully help you
write Python too!

The purpose of this program is to accept a JSON file name as an argument in the
command line, then deserialize that file into a readable object. After that,
the program will let you edit some of the details of that object then
reserialize back to the JSON file.

"Serializing" is the process of converting data from a string to an object and
back. To "serialize" is to convert an object to a string, and to
"deserialize" is to convert a string to an object. JSON files are only text,
so deserializing the file converts that text into an object, whereas serializing
will convert that dictionary back to JSON.
